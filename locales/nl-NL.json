    "scrum_body_text": "I am a Scrum Master with over 5 years of experience, holding PSM and SAFe 6.1 certifications. With a solid background in software development spanning more than 10 years, I transitioned into the Scrum Master role after earning my Master's in Business from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest. %{br} Colleagues often describe me as a builder of innovative digital solutions, an effective organizer, and someone who can develop MVPs, learn from them, and create plans for scaling. I understand the importance of delivering in increments and testing features with real users. %{br} By day, I am a dedicated Scrum Master; by night, I build startups. One of my proudest achievements is leading a project that positioned my startup as a semifinalist in the Preactilerator Chivas the Venture in 2016, where my partner became a TEDx speaker. %{br} I am grateful for the opportunity to work with amazing international teams on a variety of projects, from financial software in fintech companies like Verifone, to medical hardware with Onera Health, and AI for health medical devices. %{br} I have learned that the greatest asset is the team. As a Scrum Master, I am dedicated to creating and mentoring teams to achieve their highest potential. While I recognize my limitations, my focus is always on fostering a collaborative and productive environment, delivering high-quality code in testable increments, and leveraging continuous integration pipelines.",

But they were building a physical product, and that came with a set of challenges because the iteration did not look like professional products, and there were no lettering descriptions, etc. So we bought all the equipment and started cutting vinyl for different companies.",
