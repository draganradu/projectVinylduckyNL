With a solid background in software development spanning more than 10 years, I transitioned into the Scrum Master role after earning my Master's in Business from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest. %{br} Colleagues often describe me as a builder of innovative digital solutions, an effective organizer, and someone who can develop MVPs, learn from them, and create plans for scaling. I understand the importance of delivering in increments and testing features with real users. %{br} By day, I am a dedicated Scrum Master; by night, I build startups. One of my proudest achievements is leading a project that positioned my startup as a semifinalist in the Preactilerator Chivas the Venture in 2016, where my partner became a TEDx speaker. %{br} I am grateful for the opportunity to work with amazing international teams on a variety of projects, from financial software in fintech companies like Verifone, to medical hardware with Onera Health, and AI for health medical devices. %{br} I have learned that the greatest asset is the team. As a Scrum Master, I am dedicated to creating and mentoring teams to achieve their highest potential. While I recognize my limitations, my focus is always on fostering a collaborative and productive environment, delivering high-quality code in testable increments, and leveraging continuous integration pipelines."
